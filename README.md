# MNIST Recognizing hand written digits

## SCHOOL PROJECT

Python Jupyter Notebook 
MNIST Dataset - Recognizing my own, intentionally badly handwritten images.

## Introduction

This is an example of how to use the MNIST dataset to recognize hand written digits. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 images of hand written digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels and is labeled with the digit it represents. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The dataset is available from the [MNIST website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
